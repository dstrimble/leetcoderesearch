/*
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb")); // 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));    // 1
